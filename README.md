#ReadMe - Boussinesq Equation

In this code is implemented a conservative finite-volume numerical solution for the two-dimensional groundwater flow (Boussinesq) equation, which can be used for investigation of hillslope subsurface flow processes and simulations of catchment hydrology.

In this code is implemented the *Barenblatt power series solution of Boussinesq equation* like analytical solution of the Boussinesq equation of groundwater flow in a semi-infinite porous medium.
